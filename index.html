                        Bob Belcher, runs Bob's Burgers with the help of his wife, Linda Belcher, and their three kids, Tina Belcher, Louise Belcher, and Gene Belcher.
                        While poor with business management and cursed with an unlucky streak, his experience and skill in homemade cuisine has helped his restaurant stay afloat,
                        in spite of seemingly constant financial uncertainty, providing for his family all the while.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Linda Belcher, the happy-go-lucky, eccentric wife of Bob Belcher, and the mother of Tina, Gene and Louise.
                        Linda has a broad sense of humor, constantly joking with her family and friends. She is wise and kind to her family, and loves her family very much.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Tina Belcher, the oldest daughter of Bob Belcher and Linda Belcher and the older sister of Gene Belcher and Louise Belcher. 
                        She is in eighth grade. She is a hopeless romantic yet easily influenced person with a powerful sex drive and minimal social skills.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Gene Belcher, the middle child of Bob and Linda Belcher. He is the only boy out of the three siblings. Gene is an aspiring musician and a prankster.
                        He maintains very close relationships with both of his parents and two sisters, Tina and Louise Belcher. Gene, along with Tina, is usually a pawn in schemes set up by Louise.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Louise Belcher, the youngest daughter of Bob Belcher and Linda Belcher.
                        Her off-balance sense of humor and hunger for conflict makes her somewhat of a liability in the kitchen and often gets her family both into and/or out of tricky situations.
